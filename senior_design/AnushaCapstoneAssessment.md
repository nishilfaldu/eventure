## Individual Capstone Assessment - Anusha Chitranshi

-   For my senior design project, my friend Nishil and I thought of creating an event management application which will help people plan, organize, and execute not only the large-scale events but also little, not-so-big events while intuitively helping them make decisions for their event. From a market perspective, if I need to organize a birthday party for my 12-year-old daughter and I don’t have the budget to hire an event planner for this small-scale event, I’d have to think of every little thing and then do all of it by myself, there’s no effective technological help available which caters to my personalized need. Our idea is to create a web application which generates a checklist for you based on your own needs. This checklist then further goes on to connect you with vendors and give suggestions for individual items including but not limited to food options, decorations, party supplies, and many other things. We decided to call it “Eventure” because every event that you organize will be an adventure for both you and the people attending it. From a technological perspective, this project will include a full-stack development of the application including front-end and back-end frameworks, databases, and hosting platforms. We’ll have to implement features such as user registration, event creation, checklist generation, vendor recommendations, and integration with external services with a desirable user interface.

-   I believe my college experience has prepared me to work towards this web application overall. I took a Cloud Computing class (CS 6065) which taught me the basics of creating and hosting a web-application and integrating it with a database. My Database Design class (CS 4092) would be helpful in creating a schema for our database and visualizing all the data we will need. Currently, I am in a User Interface class (CS 5167) which will prove super beneficial in designing the UI/UX for our application. I’m hoping we will be able to integrate some generative AI in our project in which case, my AI Principles and Applications class (CS 4033) might be useful too.

-   None of my co-op experiences have been about full-stack development, however, I do believe that they have offered skills which will be helpful with the project, nonetheless. I have completed four co-op rotations: two with CERN as a Research Assistant working on the LHCb experiment and the other two with Levi Strauss and Co. as a Cloud Ops Engineer. For both my co-ops, I have worked a lot with programming languages like python which will be helpful in coding our web application framework. The use of source code repository platforms like GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket will also be an asset in this project. I do believe that the strongest skill I have acquired from both my co-ops is project management. At Levi’s, the AIML team followed an agile model for development, and we are hoping to bring that to our project too. I’m really good at task management, UI design and requirements engineering, and I am hoping to bring that to the table for this capstone.

-   The motivation for this project was definitely addressing a gap in the market. We identified a gap in the event planning market. Planning events, even small ones, can be overwhelming and time-consuming. There are existing event management tools, but they predominantly focus on larger-scale events or lack the personalization required for smaller, budget-constrained gatherings. Our project aims to fill this void by offering a tailored solution for individuals organizing events like birthday parties. By providing an intuitive tool that generates checklists and connects users with relevant vendors, we’re addressing a real need and simplifying the event planning process. Our project aims to improve the user experience by making event planning more accessible and efficient. This can reduce stress and increase the likelihood of successful, enjoyable events. Beyond the academic setting, this project may have entrepreneurial potential. If successful, this application could be developed further and potentially become a viable business venture, providing value to a broader audience.

-   This project will be considered successful when it effectively empowers individuals to plan and execute small-scale events, such as birthday parties, with ease and confidence. Success will be measured by the application's ability to generate personalized checklists that cater to users' specific needs and budgets, as well as its capability to connect users with suitable vendors and provide creative suggestions for event elements like food, decorations, and supplies. Additionally, success will manifest in user satisfaction and positive feedback, indicating that the application simplifies the event planning process, reduces stress, and enhances the overall experience. Furthermore, achieving success means creating a sustainable and scalable solution that can potentially evolve into a useful tool for a broader audience, showcasing its entrepreneurial potential. Ultimately, success is realized when the application fulfills its mission of making event planning accessible, enjoyable, and efficient for all, regardless of the event's scale or budget.
