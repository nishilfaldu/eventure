## Goals of the Project 

1. As a person who wants to plan an event or multiple events of varied scales and budgets, I want to have a platform which can help me plan the event so I don't have to hire an event planner.
2. As the event planner, I should be able to collaborate with other people helping me plan so that all of us have access to everything in one place.
3. As the event planner, I should be able to generate a personalized checklist for my event based on the information I enter about my event so I don't have to come up with every detail from scratch. 
4. As the event planner, I should see vendor options for different requirements so that I have a variety of options to choose from without going store to store. 
5. As the event planner, I should be able to plan multiple events at the same time and see all my past event deatils so I can reference back and forth when needed.
