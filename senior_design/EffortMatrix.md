| Set up the repository with the pre-requisites of the required tech stack                                                                        | 75                    | 25                     |
| Create interactive prototypes using tools like Figma.                                                                                            | 25                    | 75                     |
| Develop the visual design of the UI, including color schemes, typography, and graphical elements.                                                | 25                    | 75                     |
| Organize the content and information hierarchy effectively. Determine how data is presented and navigated within the application to ensure user comprehension and ease of use. | 50                    | 50                     |
| Prepare and deliver the final design assets, including design files, images, icons, and any other graphical elements, to the development team     | 25                    | 75                     |
| Define the data model for your application. Identify the entities (e.g., users, events, vendors, items) and their relationships. Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the structure of your database. | 50 | 50 |
| Design the database schema based on the data model. Define tables, columns, and data types. Establish primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity. | 50 | 50 |
| Implement data validation rules to ensure that only valid and consistent data is stored in the database. Define constraints, triggers, and validation rules as needed. | 75 | 25 |
| Define the user authentication flow using Clerk.dev. This flow includes user registration, login, password reset, and session management. Clear authentication ensures secure access to the application and user data. | 90 | 10 |
| Implement a NGINX reverse proxy. This reverse proxy serves multiple purposes, including security enhancement by acting as a protective barrier between the internet and your application servers. | 50 | 50 |
| Design the Keystone backend. Keystone is a powerful framework for building GraphQL APIs and content management systems. | 90 | 10 |
| Integrate the Prisma layer with Keystone. Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and operations. The integration with Keystone ensures efficient data handling, including CRUD operations and database interactions, for a smooth and performant backend. | 10 | 90 |
| Develop the Next.js frontend of the application. This involves creating the user interface, implementing client-side rendering for a smoother user experience, and ensuring that the frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend through APIs. | 50 | 50 |
| Improve frontend performance by implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for images. | 80 | 20 |
| Validate the functionality of the Next.js frontend. This includes testing user interfaces, verifying dynamic behavior, and ensuring that user interactions produce the expected results. | 20 | 80 |
| Contribute to frontend readiness by developing GraphQL resolvers in the Keystone backend. GraphQL resolvers are responsible for fetching and delivering data to the frontend. | 75 | 25 |
| Integrate frontend with backend and perform exhaustive testing. | 50 | 50 |
