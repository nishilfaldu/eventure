The ABET concerns and constraints discussed in our project were as follows: 

### Economic:
- Financial Limitations: The development and maintenance of the event management application may have financial constraints. These limitations can impact the choice of software tools, resources, and whether the project relies on freeware, shareware, or has a budget for purchases.
- Funding Source: The source of funds for the project, whether personal savings, university funding, affects the financial flexibility and resources available for development. It also affects the code quality as the availability of code analysis tools leads to better code quality
- Economic Development: The application can contribute to economic development by creating opportunities for event planners, vendors, and service providers, potentially stimulating local economies.

### Professional:
- Specialized Expertise: Depending on the complexity and scale of the project, specialized expertise in areas such as event planning, software development, or legal matters may be required to ensure its success.

### Ethical:
- Moral Impact: The application should be designed with ethical considerations in mind. It should promote ethical behavior and not enable or support activities that could be considered morally questionable or harmful.
- User Privacy and Data Ethics: Ethical handling of user data is crucial. Clear privacy policies, secure data handling practices, and user consent mechanisms should be in place to protect users' privacy and data rights.

### Legal:
- Intellectual Property: Legal issues related to intellectual property (IP) should be addressed. Ensure that any third-party IP used in the application is properlylicensed or permission has been obtained to avoid copyright or trademark disputes.

### Security:
- Data Security: Protecting user data from threats like data breaches or unauthorized access is paramount. Robust security measures should be implemented to safeguard user information.
- Privacy Concerns: Address privacy concerns by establishing stringent privacy policies and practices. Users should have confidence that their personal information is handled securely and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

### Social:
- Public Service: The application can serve as a platform for public service or nonprofit events, contributing to the betterment of society by making event planning more accessible and efficient.
- Quality of Life: By simplifying event planning, reducing stress, and improving overall quality of life for users, the application can have a positive social impact.

### Diversity and Cultural:
- Cultural Constraints: Recognizing any cultural factors, like language preferences or local customs, may influence user adoption of the application. Ensure that the application is culturally inclusive and accessible to a diverse audience.
- Promoting Diversity: Promote diversity and inclusivity within the application, both in its user base and in the vendors and service providers it connects with by encourage a diverse range of event planners and participants.

Addressing these constraints will help us develop an event management application that not only meets user needs but also operates within ethical, legal, and security boundaries while contributing positively to society and promoting cultural inclusivity and diversity.
